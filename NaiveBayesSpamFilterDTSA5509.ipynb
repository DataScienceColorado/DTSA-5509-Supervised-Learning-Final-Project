    "# Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with Logistic Regression to compare the two models. We aim to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 90% — so we expect that more than 90% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our algorithm, we will use a dataset of 5,572 pre-classified (spam vs. non-spam) text messages. The dataset can be downloaded from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). When it comes to training the algorithm, we'll be teaching it how to classify messages from the perspective of a human as accurately as possible. This means we want the algorithm to see text messages through our eyes as humans would when we look at a message and can tell whether it's spam. With this knowledge, the algorithm will classify new messages and tell us how many are spam or ham. It's based on probability, and the algorithm combines everything it learns to make it as accurate as possible."

    "So when comparing the Naive Bayes method which gives roughly a 99% filter accuracy and then looking at the Logistic Regression model accuracy of roughly 87%, the clear winner model wise is the Naive Bayes model. The reason for this more likely than not is that Naive Bayes is typically more suited for spam filtering tasks such as this one. Naive Bayes typically will assume that all features are independent of each other given the class label of either \"ham\" or \"spam\". This works well with text classification which is what this dataset is focused on. So while Logistic Regression isn't bad, Naive Bayes is the way to go when it comes to datasets trying to filter text."

    "In this project, we built a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm as well as filtering spam messages with Logistic Regression as a comparison. The filter had an accuracy of 98.74% on the test set we used with Naive Bayes, which is a really good result. Logistic Regression had about 87% accuracy. Our initial goal was an accuracy of over 90%, and we managed to do way better than that with the Naive Bayes model."
